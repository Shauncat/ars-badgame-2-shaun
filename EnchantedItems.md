>When placed upon the back of a person, this saddle turns its wearer into a half-Arabyan jennet horse. This allowes someone with little to no knowledge of horsemanship and without the resources to purchase, rear, and stable a horse permanently, the long-distance travel capacities of a seasoned rider. This was originally woven for Zita, so that she could complete more deliveries during a season of Redcap duty. However, she remains at least somewhat aware that the saddle might actually end up strapped to a grog. But her path in life is to create enchanted items, not regulate their usage.
